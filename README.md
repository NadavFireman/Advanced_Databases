# Advanced Databases: SQL Architecture and Performance

This repository contains the solutions for the core exercises in the Advanced Databases course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The course focuses on the architectural and performance aspects of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), demonstrating expertise in concurrency control, security, and query optimization.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Concurrency Control (Transactions):** Understanding and applying ACID properties, managing transactions (COMMIT/ROLLBACK), and analyzing concepts of serializability and locking mechanisms to prevent Deadlock.
* **Query Optimization (Indexes):** Designing and implementing Indexes (Clustered and Non-Clustered) for performance enhancement and understanding the trade-offs in storage and retrieval efficiency.
* **Views and Security:** Creating complex Views for simplified querying and utilizing them as a security layer for data access and integrity (WITH CHECK OPTION).
* **Advanced DDL/DML:** Implementing sophisticated Sub-queries, utilizing set operators (EXISTS/NOT EXISTS), and applying security procedures (GRANT/REVOKE).
* **NoSQL Foundations:** Conceptual understanding of the differences between RDBMS and NoSQL systems (MongoDB, etc.).
